def array_sht_filters_theory_radInverse(R, nMic, order_sht, Lfilt, fs, amp_threshold):
    """
    Generate SHT filters based on theoretical responses (regularized radial inversion)

    Parameters
    ----------
    R : float
        Microphone array radius, in meter.
    nMic : int
        Number of microphone capsules.
    order_sht : int
        Spherical harmonic transform order.
    Lfilt : int
        Number of FFT points for the output filters. It must be even.
    fs : int
        Sample rate for the output filters.
    amp_threshold : float
         Max allowed amplification for filters, in dB.

    Returns
    -------
    h_filt : ndarray
        Impulse responses of the filters. Dimension = (Lfilt, order_sht+1).
    H_filt: ndarray
        Frequency-domain filters. Dimension = (Lfilt//2+1, order_sht+1).

    Raises
    -----
    TypeError, ValueError: if method arguments mismatch in type, dimension or value.
    UserWarning: if `nMic` not big enough for the required sht order.

    Notes
    -----
    Generate the filters to convert microphone signals from a spherical
    microphone array to SH signals, based on an ideal theoretical model of
    the array. The filters are generated from an inversion of the radial
    components of the response, neglecting spatial aliasing effects and
    non-ideal arrangements of the microphones. One filter is shared by all
    SH signals of the same order in this case.
    Here this single channel inversion problem is done with a constraint on
    max allowed amplification regularization, using Tikhonov
    regularization, similar e.g. to:

        Moreau, S., Daniel, J., Bertet, S., 2006,
        3D sound field recording with higher order ambisonics-objective
        measurements and validation of spherical microphone.
        In Audio Engineering Society Convention 120.
